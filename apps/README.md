# Bundled apps

Each folder here describes one RISC OS application that ships on the disc. Nothing in `build/` is committed: the game binaries are fetched at build time, same as the ROM stays out of the repo.

`tools/mkapps.py` reads every `app.json` and writes `build/rom.bin`, which is the ROM with a small `DreamApps` module added, followed by a ResourceFS pack of the app files. The app folder then appears in the Apps window. `tools/armxlat.py` recompiles the app's ARM code ahead of time into its own overlay unit, `ov_N.bin` on the disc.

Neither part is loaded at boot. Pack pages stream through the ROM page cache when a file is read, and the code unit loads when the app first jumps to its entry point.

## app.json

- `name`: application folder, listed under `Apps`
- `upstream`: files to download, pinned by commit and sha256
- `files`: folder contents, from `local` files here, `upstream` keys or `basic` text to tokenise, with a filetype or a load and exec address
- `files[].unpack`: set to `scorpress` to store the file unpacked, for code the app would decompress itself. Names can hold a subfolder, as in `Data.AllMods`
- `code.file`: the file holding ARM code, which must have `load` and `exec`
- `code.seeds`: extra entry points, as `tools/converge.sh` finds them
- `code.tables`: tables of code pointers, as `[address, count]`
- `code.frame_us`: vertical sync period while the app runs, for games whose speed depends on frame rate. Lander runs at 25Hz. An 8MHz ARM2 managed ~15 frames/s by instruction count, so raise this for a slower, closer game
- `code.modules`: `file`, `base` and `count` for voice modules the app inserts in place from a packed file. Their words go in the RAM table, as they run from the app's memory
- `code.pad`: key codes (row in the high nibble) for `left`, `right`, `up`, `down`, `a`, `b`, `x` and `start` on the controller, for games with no use for a pointer. Without it the controller stays a mouse

Code the static walk misses shows up as "no native code" on the harness. Inside the app's own image, add the address to `code.seeds`. `tools/converge.sh` only knows about ROM and RAM words, so it will fill `trace/ramwords.txt` with junk if pointed at those.

## Tertis

We skip its launcher, `!RunImage` in the upstream app. That's a splash screen and a ScorPress decompressor, so we unpack `TertisCode` at build time (`tools/scorpress.py`) and ship that as `!RunImage`. `!Run` does the launcher's other job, setting the screen to 160K. Doing it from BASIC is the only way that's simple, as `*ChangeDynamicArea` has no screen option on 3.11.

Of note is that `adfs/Code/TetrisCode` upstream is a different build from the one that shipped, so don't use it. The launcher's exec address, `0x749F4`, sits 8 bytes ahead of the code at `0x749FC`, on two words that do nothing. We enter at the code.
