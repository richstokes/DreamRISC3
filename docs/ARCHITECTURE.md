# Architecture

## Problem Statement

Dream-TOS could compile EmuTOS because it is C. RISC OS 3.11 only exists as 2MB of 26-bit ARM code, and the goal is a native port with no emulator or JIT.

## Proposal

1. `tools/romscan.py` maps the ROM (kernel plus 88 modules) and finds code
2. `tools/armxlat.py` turns every reachable ARM instruction into C. Blocks are functions joined by `musttail` calls, so ARM calls never use the host stack
3. `src/mach.c` is the machine layer: PSR and register banks, page tables, and native drivers behind the old MEMC, IOC, VIDC, keyboard and CMOS register addresses
4. `src/dc/main.c` is KOS video and Maple input. `src/host/main.c` is a Mac harness that runs the same generated C with deterministic time

## How code gets found

Boot traces come from a dev-only hook in Arculator (`ARC_PCMAP`). Static discovery adds module entry points, command tables, ADR targets, jump tables, stored ROM addresses and `lr`-saving prologues. Network and printer modules are skipped unless a trace proves they run.

A jump to code that was not recompiled stops the harness with its address. `tools/converge.sh` turns those stops into `trace/seeds.txt` and `trace/ramwords.txt`. On the console it raises a prefetch abort, so RISC OS reports an error and only the task dies.

## Code that runs from RAM

RISC OS copies and generates a little code at runtime (the IRQ head, SWI stubs, sound voices, BASIC's `SYS`, SharedCLibrary branch tables).

Each known instruction word gets one precompiled routine that takes its PC as an argument, looked up by word. SWI words, branch words and the `LDMIA r12!,{list}` that C apps build on the stack for SWI veneers share a routine each, since those read the word for their number, offset or register list.

**This is the part closest to an emulator, so to be plain about it:** RAM code runs one routine per instruction through a table lookup, and those three routines do read the instruction word. Nothing is generated at runtime, and unknown words do not run. New ARM binaries cannot run; apps have to be part of the build, like Dream-TOS.

## Disc streaming

The disc holds `rom.bin` and `ov_N.bin`. Under dcload the console reads the same files over `/pc`.

- ROM data: hot pages load into RAM at boot; 12 cold pages stream through an 8-slot cache, using the page tables. Fewer are cold than you'd hope. The kernel walks module headers on every service call and ResourceFS scans Messages and ROMFonts. Those cold pages also go hot once `!Draw` runs (28k disc reads with 3 slots, 21 with 8), so only ~130KB leaves RAM
- Code: blocks outside the boot trace in `!Draw`, `!Paint` and a misc group (printing, network, DOSFS) become overlay units linked to one fixed region. A dispatch miss loads the unit. Blocks keep no native stack, so swapping at any dispatch is safe. Boot never loads code from disc
- SharedCLibrary, BASIC and FileCore stay resident on purpose, as every app uses them and paging them would mean a seek per task switch

Console check (10/31): the `tests/draw.replay` drawing session matched the harness at both checkpoints, with its two key events removed on both sides because hardware replays do not support keys yet.


Net saving is ~0.9MB. Running `!Draw` and `!Paint` together will reload a unit each time focus moves between them, ~1s each: untested and it will be ugly.

Machine state lives in r14 on SH-4 (`-ffixed-r14` is required, or GCC borrows the register) which saves ~0.5MB and gained ~14% idle throughput on the console.

## Bundled apps

Dropped ARM binaries still cannot run, so a bundled app is recompiled like the ROM. `apps/` has one folder per app and [apps/README.md](../apps/README.md) covers the manifest. There are two parts, and neither loads at boot:

- Files: `tools/mkapps.py` appends a ResourceFS pack to `rom.bin`, mapped at `0x3C00000` through the cold page cache. A small `DreamApps` module, added to the ROM's module chain, registers it, so the app appears under `Apps` like any other. Every ResourceFS lookup walks every file header, so the pack keeps headers in its first page and files only cost a disc read when opened. Boot reads that one page
- Code: each app is an overlay unit. It runs at its load address, which other tasks share, so a unit only starts from its entry point with the right instruction there, and entries from outside are checked against the instruction they were compiled from

Decision: extend the Apps folder, not a new filing system. A virtual drive would need a FileSwitch filing system plus a Filer icon, and it would get us nothing until a game needs more than 2MB of files, the size of the pack window. Down the road a real drive is the way to go for that, and for the game's own save files.

App units are small enough to spend code on speed. Each is one file at `-O2`, memory access and `LDM`/`STM` are inline, and returns go through a direct map. On the console that took Lander's heavy scene from 25 to ~48 frames/s, worst case 17 to 40, for 47KB to 93KB of unit, which only exists in memory while the app runs.

Apps can be far bigger than Lander. Tertis has ~20k instructions, or ~840KB of unit against the 1.1MB region, and code from `ADD`/`SUB` address pairs and `STMFD ...,lr` prologues is walked as well. Everything translated flow dispatches to has to be an entry too, as one failed lookup marks the app as stopped.

Lander's physics run per frame, with only the vsync wait to limit them, so that speed made it far too fast. `code.frame_us` sets the app's vertical sync period, without touching OS timers. Lander uses 25Hz. An 8MHz ARM2 would manage ~15 frames/s going by ~150-290K ARM instructions a frame at ~4 MIPS, which is an estimate and not a measurement on real Acorn hardware, so it's probably still a bit quicker than the original. Open question: does it feel right on a pad?

## Storage

`src/fdc.c` is a native driver behind the WD1772 registers, so RISC OS's own ADFS and FileCore run unchanged, including their FIQ byte transfers. The disc (`assets/adfs.adf.gz`) is an 800KB ADFS E image that RISC OS formatted itself on the harness via `tests/format.replay`. It loads into RAM at boot, so writes work but vanish at power off.

Things that bit us, for whoever touches this next:

- IOC control bit 2 set means a disc is present
- Sector IDs have to arrive at about 40ms each. ADFS collects a track's IDs into a 512-byte stack buffer until a timer says one revolution passed, so answering instantly overruns the buffer and smashes the stack
- ADFS copies a different FIQ routine to the vector page per operation, and runs one from the SVC stack. Those words are in `trace/ramwords.txt`

Harness: `DREAM_ADF` loads an image (a missing file means blank), `DREAM_ADF_OUT` saves it on exit, and the replay verb `type` drives the keyboard.

Console check (10/31): opened `:0` in the Filer with the checksum matching the harness. Reading from a physical disc or GDEMU is untested, and writing has only run on the harness.

## Display

`assets/cmos.bin` sets MonitorType 3 (VGA), WimpMode 27 and clears the auto mode bit (logical `0xC3` bit 4), so the desktop boots at 640x480 and draws to the Dreamcast framebuffer 1:1. Hand patched and checksummed, as `*Configure` isn't in the recompiled code. The harness can save CMOS with `DREAM_CMOS_OUT`.

A framebuffer dump in Flycast (`HW_DUMP=1`) shows the desktop sharp at full size with the right colours.

The old mode 12 screen was only 256 lines, so this nearly doubles the lines summed per frame. Present stays ~4% of the frame budget in Flycast. It costs ~70KB of guest RAM for the bigger screen.

Things to watch out for:

- Windows sit ~16 pointer units lower than they did in mode 12, while the icon bar stays anchored to the bottom. The replays were moved to match
- On a TV cable KOS outputs 640x480 interlaced, so 1 pixel lines will flicker, where the line doubled 256 line modes did not. VGA is fine. Untested on a real TV, and if it's bad the answer is probably to pick mode 12 at boot by cable type
- VSync stays at 50Hz, though real mode 27 is 60Hz. Nothing seems to care

## Sound

The ROM's own SoundDMA, SoundChannels and voice modules run unchanged. A native driver in `src/mach.c` sits behind the MEMC sound registers: at each buffer swap it converts VIDC's log samples to 16-bit stereo using the stereo image registers and hands them to `plat_sound`. Several channels fold into one output frame, so 8 channels at a 6us period still output at 20.8kHz.

On the Dreamcast, a ring feeds a KOS `snd_stream` from its own thread, so sound keeps going while the machine blocks on disc, and a short gap holds the last frame instead of clicking. Latency is ~100-150ms. That thread runs inside KOS, where r14 is not the machine state, so it must never touch `C`.

Mid-buffer changes are not modelled, as buffers go out whole, and the VIDC clock is assumed to be 24MHz. SoundDMA's 48us period gives the right pitch in mode 27 regardless.

Harness: `DREAM_WAV` records output. `tests/sound.replay` plays middle C from BASIC and `tools/soundcheck.py` checks its pitch (258Hz measured, by counting zero crossings). Lander has no Sound SWIs at all, so it's silent, as it should be.

Console check (10/31, Flycast only): checkpoints matched the harness, and over 60s the ring stayed in step at 20.8kHz with no gaps after start up. Nobody has listened to it yet.

## SD hard disc

`src/ide.c` is a native ATA drive at the IDE registers ROM ADFS already drives (`0x30107C0`, IOC IRQB bit 3). Sectors map 1:1 onto SD blocks, read with KOS's `sd_read_blocks`. At boot, a detected card sets `IDEDiscs` in CMOS (top bits of byte 0x87, checksum at 0x3F) and the floppy image is not loaded.

ROM patch: ADFS only starts IDE on IOEB machines or if a podule claims it, and reporting IOEB would move the floppy to the 82C711 path. So `tools/armxlat.py` NOPs that one branch at recompile time, and checks the old word first.

`src/hdformat.c` writes the disc, as HForm is not in ROM: 120 zones, 1K map units, ~476MB. Map and directory checksums were checked against a disc RISC OS formatted itself. `*verify 4` passes, on the harness and on a real 4GB card.

Things that bit us:

- ADFS reads sector 1 by polling with nIEN set, then re-enables interrupts and waits. The drive has to latch an interrupt raised while masked, or the transfer hangs
- A read failure must never count as "unformatted". `hd_is_formatted()` returns -1 for that, and only a readable, wrong boot block offers to format

Console results (10/31): real card formatted, written, power cycled and read back, with `Work` still there and every checkpoint matching the harness. Boot block detection was stable over 4 more power cycles.

On the final merged build (sound, 640x480) the card test passed by eye from a console screen dump: `Work` persisted, spool wrote, `Verified OK`. Its checksum differed from the harness only because one scripted space was dropped (`*cdiradfs::4...`). That may be a real keyboard timing issue while the disc is busy, so check it if typing ever loses characters.

Unresolved: during bring-up the second boot looked freshly formatted, which suggests the first check said "not formatted" on a card that had just been formatted. That build could format unattended. I never found out why and it has not recurred, but treat it as open while the card holds anything you care about.

Not tested: the format prompt on a real controller or keyboard (hardware tests use `HW_AUTOFORMAT`), SD speed under load, and pulling the card out while running.

## Network

RISC OS 3.11 has no TCP/IP in ROM, and Acorn's Internet module was a disc-based ARM binary. So the stack is native (KOS) and the guest reaches it through DreamNet SWIs at `&CDC00`, a chunk from the range RISC OS leaves to users. `src/net.c` catches them in `swi_insn` before the kernel sees them. Results come back in r0 as a value or -errno, and there's no V-set error path, as nothing guest-side owns memory for an error block. We skipped Acorn's `Socket_*` numbers since no existing binary could call them anyway.

| SWI | Name | Registers |
|---|---|---|
| +0 | Status | r0 -> 80 byte block: state, link, ip, mask, gateway, dns, mac, device, text |
| +1 | Connect | r0 -> 80 byte config |
| +2 | Disconnect | |
| +3 | Ping | r0 = ip, r1 = seq |
| +4 | PingResult | r0 = seq; out r0 = 1 if answered, r1 = us, r2 = ttl |
| +5 | Resolve | r0 -> name |
| +6 | ResolveResult | out r0 = 1 ok, 0 waiting, -1 failed; r1 = ip |
| +7 | GetConfig | r0 -> 80 byte block |
| +8 | SaveConfig | r0 -> config, written to a VMU |
| +9 to +16 | SockOpen, Bind, Connect, Send, Recv, SendTo, RecvFrom, Close | non-blocking; -35 means try again |

Addresses are one word, most significant byte first. Blocks are laid out in `src/net.h`.

The abstraction is a table of links in `src/dc/net.c`. KOS's `netif_t` already hides the BBA, LAN Adapter and W5500, and PPP registers as a netif too, so a link only says how to bring itself up:

- Auto tries BBA then LAN, with DHCP, from power on. No setup needed. `!Ping` defaults to the gateway it got
- Modem dials, then runs PPP (`libppp`). A DreamPi is just a PPP peer, so `111-1111`, `dream`, `dreamcast` work OOTB. Never automatic, as it ties up a phone line. Pick it in `!NetSetup` and Save
- W5500 has to be picked by name. Its probe flips SCIF into SPI, which would upset a serial console, and it refuses outright if an SD card holds the port. One serial port, so it's W5500 or SD hard disc, not both

Things that bit us, for whoever touches this next:

- Everything blocking runs on one worker thread, which must never touch `C`: r14 only holds machine state on the main thread. `src/net.h` stays free of `cpu.h` for that reason
- `net_init` waits up to 10s for link, so it can't run at boot on the main thread. The exception is dcload-ip, where KOS has to take the BBA over before anything uses it. `arch_init_net_dcload_ip` then carries dcload's traffic, and `/pc` keeps working
- KOS's dialler stops at any character with no tone, so dashes are stripped
- Never print on the receive path, including the ICMP echo callback. Under dcload a `printf` travels through that same path and waits for itself, which froze the whole console at the first ping reply
- BASIC 1.05 only tokenises text from `*BASIC -load`, and prints "Program renumbered" over the desktop while it does. `tools/basic.py` tokenises at build time. Its output matched BASIC's own `SAVE` byte for byte on both apps

The harness has a scripted link in virtual time (`src/host/net.c`), so replays checksum the apps. Sockets are shared code in `src/net_sock.c`.

Memory: ~100KB of code, and ~120KB of heap once the BBA is up, leaving ~900KB free.

Console (10/31), real BBA under dcload-ip: the KOS takeover works, `/pc` and the log keep running, DHCP gave the address and gateway, and a native test pinged the gateway 12 of 12 times at 2-3.6ms. `!Ping` opened on the real desktop and filled in the gateway.

Open question: under dcload a scripted `!Ping` launch only opened 1 time in 3, with no error, and that one time Return then did nothing. ROM page sums matched Flycast, an SD card makes no difference on the harness, and the F12 line typed correctly, so it's not corrupt data or a bad command. I suspect dcload sharing the BBA, since nothing else here differs and it never happened in Flycast or on the harness, but that's unproven. Next step is booting the CDI from GDEMU with no dcload at all. `!Ping` driven by hand on a console, Modem on a real DreamPi, and the W5500 are all untested.

Flycast (10/31): `!Ping` launched by replay and ran through the real KOS driver against the emulated BBA (DHCP, ICMP replies at 2-22ms) and emulated modem (PPP at 33600, replies at 60-80ms).

## Considerations

- Size: ~1.2MB of ARM becomes ~8.5MB of SH-4 plus ~1MB of tables, so ~7x. Out-of-line memory helpers and whole-ROM flag liveness are already in, and the latter only saved ~1%
- The old hardware registers are still the interface between ROM code and drivers. Replacing the kernel's drivers outright is a later step, not needed to reach the desktop
- Open question: Flycast timing is not hardware timing, and interpreter-free does not automatically mean fast. Needs a real console run

## Testing

Flycast's pointer can drift from the host mouse, so use scripted input on the harness.

```bash
tools/converge.sh tests/apps.replay 136
```

Replays hold `move`, `button`, `key` and `shot` lines. Slam to a corner first for a fixed origin. Pointer scale is ~1.5px per unit across and down in mode 27, ~0.75 down in mode 12.

The harness and the screen checksums read guest RAM, so neither one sees bugs in the Dreamcast display path in `src/dc/main.c`. Check that in Flycast by eye. A window capture goes stale while another window covers Flycast, so check an `HW_DUMP=1` framebuffer dump as well. `dump_screen` only fires on a replay's seventh `shot`, and serial is slow, so a dump takes a few minutes.

## Hardware Results (10/31)

The Good: 8 of 9 boots reached the desktop, checksum `C50F35BC`, same as the harness. The replay run matched all three checkpoints, so the Filer, BASIC and a C app behave identically on the SH-4. Boot is ~26-31s, at ~49 of 50 frames/s.

The Bad: boot 2 stuck at the 1bpp screen (`66733280`) for 90s+ with polls taking ~73us instead of ~15us. That looks like an interrupt or keyboard retry storm, but that's a guess: the run had no PC logging. 88 randomised clock runs on the harness and 6 more console boots did not reproduce it.

Not checked: actual speed under load (polls count branches and IO, so they are not a MIPS figure), physical input, and what the video output looks like on a screen.

Heartbeat builds use `HW_LOG=1`, and `HW_REPLAY=1` adds a generated `build/replay.h` from `tools/replay2c.py`. Screen checksums are the only way to verify a console run unattended. If a boot is stuck in 1bpp at 30s the heartbeat dumps IOC state and recent SWIs.

Lander on the console (10/31): 124-125 game frames per 5s for a whole scripted flight, ~60% of the CPU left over in the heaviest scene, launch with no visible stall over dcload. Before pacing, the profile put the heavy scene at ~22% vertex projection (software division), ~23% triangle setup and ~12% span fills.

The video output was checked from a framebuffer dump in Flycast (`HW_DUMP=1` and `tools/fbdump.py`): full width, correct colours, matching the harness. It is still not a real TV. The dump also found a line that checksums cannot see, as they only cover guest memory: a line hash built on rotates cancelled on solid 256 pixel fills and left stale pixels.

Console and harness checkpoints stop matching in Lander once it moves, because replays run on wall time and the frame the game has reached differs. Static scenes matched.

Tertis in Flycast (10/31): launched from Apps and played by script through to a framebuffer dump, same score as the harness. ~250 frames per 5s with the sound ring flowing and no gaps during play, with its voice modules running through the RAM table. Real hardware is untested, and nobody has listened to it, only measured the recording on the harness. The controller map is untested too, as replays drive keys and mouse.

Overlay files are padded to whole sectors. In Flycast a read of `ov_4.bin`'s short last sector never returned, with sound or without. No idea why, as `ov_3.bin` had a short tail and loaded fine, and padding fixed it, so it might be worth a look down the road.

## Next Steps

1. Look at the real screen, try physical keyboard and mouse, and catch the boot hang if it recurs
2. Use more of the card: FileCore in 3.11 tops out near 512MB per disc, so maybe several drives
3. Listen to the sound on a console, and check mode 27 on a TV as well as VGA
4. Network: run `!Ping` on a console without dcload, dial a real DreamPi, try a real W5500, and exercise the socket SWIs from a BASIC program
